Clone of Henrik Lindberg's chart which he created using R ([see his tweet](https://twitter.com/hnrklndbrg/status/883675698300420098)). Just curious how to implement this type of chart in D3.

His description of the chart:
> ### Peak time of day for sports and leisure
> Number of participants throughout the day compared to peak popularity. Note the morning-and-evening everyday workouts, the midday hobbies, and the evenings/late nights out.

The data and script to process the data came from Henrik's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/halhen/viz-pub/tree/master/sports-time-of-day). The data source is the [American Time Use Survey](https://www.bls.gov/tus/) at the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
